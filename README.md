## About
This is the first *Beta Version* of a DNN Theme version based on the Bootstrap Simple Sidebar Starter Theme.
Please note that this DNN Theme will stay as near to the Bootstrap 5 Template as Possible, so with the Template's limitations

## Notes:

- The Theme uses Gulp to parse the SCSS and als to copy the Containers from the _src/Containers folder to the appropriate DNN container folder.
- I hard coded the paths for now (in gulp.js) but that will be changes for the next version.
- I'll also add more documentation on setting up the development environment to create a modified version

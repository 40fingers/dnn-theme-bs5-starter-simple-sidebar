# DNNCMS Theme: Boostrap 5 Simple Side Menu Starter Theme
DNN Theme version of the Bootstrap Simple Sidebar Starte Theme.
Please note that this DNN Theme will stay as near to the Bootstrap Template as Possible, so with the Templates limitations

## Notes:

The Theme uses Gulp to parse the SCSS and als to copy the Containers from the _src/Containers folder to the appropriate DNN container folder.
I hard coded the paths for now (in gulp.js) but that will be changes for the next version.
